# Jenkins CI/CD Production Template

This repository showcases a **fully production-ready, GitOps-based CI/CD platform template** for hosting **Jenkins in Kubernetes**, built with scalability, security, and automation in mind. It is not just a demo â€” itâ€™s an **enterprise-grade reference implementation** demonstrating how to run Jenkins with modern best practices for infrastructure-as-code, declarative configuration, and cloud-native integrations.

Designed for real-world production use cases, this setup allows you to:

* Provision Jenkins entirely from Git using **GitOps workflows**.
* Restore a fully configured Jenkins instance â€” including plugins, credentials, jobs, and pipelines â€” with a single sync.
* Integrate seamlessly with Kubernetes-native services for container image building, quality scanning, and artifact management.

This project reflects **hands-on expertise in building robust DevOps platforms** and can serve as both a production deployment template and a strong portfolio example for demonstrating advanced CI/CD implementation skills.

## âœ¦ Features

* **GitOps-Ready Jenkins Template** â€” Deployed entirely as code with Helm + JCasC, integrated with Kubernetes for dynamic pod agents.
* **MinIO Build Cache** â€” Preconfigured S3 bucket for BuildKit cache layers, significantly reducing build times.
* **Secure CI/CD Principles** â€” Pipeline includes:

  * **Gitleaks** for secret scanning.
  * **Trivy (Filesystem Scan)** for scanning project dependencies.
  * **Trivy (Image Scan)** for scanning container images after build and before push.
  * **BuildKit** as a secure, efficient image builder.
  * **SonarQube** for code quality checks.
* **Harbor Integration** â€” Configured as the container registry for storing built images.
* **External Secrets Ready** â€” Credentials and tokens retrieved from Kubernetes Secrets designed for use with External Secrets Operator.
* **Shared Jenkins Library** â€” Centralized Groovy helpers and Kubernetes pod templates for consistent pipeline stages.

## ðŸ“‘ Example Pipeline Workflow

A representative pipeline (`Jenkinsfile_currencyservice`) demonstrates the following automated flow:

1. **Source Retrieval** â€“ Clones the specified branch from GitHub using secure credentials stored in Kubernetes Secrets.
2. **Secret Detection** â€“ Executes Gitleaks to scan the codebase for hardcoded secrets and sensitive information.
3. **Static Code Analysis** â€“ Runs SonarQube analysis to identify code quality issues and enforce coding standards.
4. **Quality Gate Enforcement** â€“ Verifies the SonarQube Quality Gate, halting the pipeline if the required thresholds are not met.
5. **Filesystem Vulnerability Scan** â€“ Uses Trivy to inspect project dependencies and detect known vulnerabilities.
6. **Container Image Build** â€“ Leverages BuildKit with MinIO-based caching to efficiently build container images.
7. **Post-Build Image Security Scan** â€“ Runs Trivy on the generated container image to detect vulnerabilities before publishing.
8. **Artifact Publishing** â€“ Pushes the verified container image to the Harbor registry for deployment.

This workflow integrates **security, quality assurance, and performance optimization** into each stage, ensuring that only validated, production-ready images are deployed.

## ðŸ“„ Use Cases

This template is ideal for:

* **Enterprise-Grade CI/CD Deployments** â€“ Running Jenkins in Kubernetes with full GitOps control and automated recovery.
* **Security-Focused Pipelines** â€“ Integrating code quality checks, vulnerability scans, and secret detection into every build.
* **Microservices Development** â€“ Managing multiple services with isolated, reproducible, and scalable pipelines.
* **Cloud-Native DevOps** â€“ Leveraging Kubernetes-native tools like BuildKit, Harbor, and MinIO for optimized workflows.
* **Disaster Recovery and Migration** â€“ Rapidly redeploying Jenkins and all related configurations in new clusters with minimal downtime.
