# Jenkins CI Production Template

## ðŸ“– About This Project

This repository is a **fully production-ready, GitOps-based CI/CD platform template** for hosting **Jenkins in Kubernetes**. It is designed to showcase modern DevOps best practices and serves as a **portfolio-grade example** of building a complete, secure, and scalable CI/CD environment from scratch.

The template demonstrates:

* How to implement **GitOps workflows** for automated, reproducible deployments.
* How to integrate security, quality checks, and performance optimizations directly into the delivery pipeline.
* How to structure a platform using a **multi-repository approach**:

  * **Platform repository** (this repo) â€“ Jenkins config, pipelines, and integrated services.
  * **Jenkins Shared Library repository** â€“ Reusable pipeline functions and pod templates.
  * **Application GitOps repository** â€“ Manages deployments of platform services.
  * **Per-service repositories** â€“ Each with webhooks triggering MultiBranch Pipelines.

This setup is not just theoreticalâ€”it is a working production-grade design, though it requires the supporting repositories to function end-to-end.

## âœ¦ Features

* **GitOps-Ready Jenkins** â€” Fully declarative deployment using Helm + JCasC.
* **MinIO Build Cache** â€” Preconfigured S3 bucket for BuildKit cache layers to drastically reduce build times.
* **Security at Every Step**:

  * **Gitleaks** â€“ Secret scanning.
  * **Trivy** â€“ Filesystem vulnerability scan.
  * **Trivy** â€“ Image vulnerability scan post-build, pre-push.
  * **BuildKit** â€“ Secure, efficient image builder.
  * **SonarQube** â€“ Static code analysis and Quality Gates.
* **Harbor Integration** â€” Private container registry with retention and security features.
* **External Secrets Operator Ready** â€” Secure credentials management.
* **Shared Jenkins Library** â€” Reusable Groovy helpers and Kubernetes pod templates.

## ðŸ“‘ Example Pipeline Workflow

A representative pipeline (`Jenkinsfile_currencyservice`) includes:

1. **Source Retrieval** â€“ Secure GitHub clone from branch.
2. **Secret Detection** â€“ Gitleaks scan for hardcoded credentials.
3. **Static Code Analysis** â€“ SonarQube quality checks.
4. **Quality Gate Enforcement** â€“ Fail build if standards are not met.
5. **Filesystem Vulnerability Scan** â€“ Trivy scans dependencies.
6. **Container Image Build** â€“ BuildKit with MinIO caching.
7. **Image Security Scan** â€“ Trivy scans the final image.
8. **Artifact Publishing** â€“ Push image to Harbor.

This ensures **only validated, secure, and production-ready images** reach deployment.

## ðŸ›  Skills Demonstrated

* Kubernetes (Helm, manifests, GitOps)
* Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasC)
* Build optimization with BuildKit + MinIO caching
* Security scanning integration (Gitleaks, Trivy, SonarQube)
* Private container registry management (Harbor)
* CI/CD best practices for microservices
* Multi-repo DevOps workflows

---

## ðŸ“„ Use Cases

* **Enterprise CI/CD** â€“ Deploy Jenkins in Kubernetes with full GitOps control.
* **Security-Focused Delivery** â€“ Block insecure code or images before deployment.
* **Optimized Builds** â€“ Reduce build time with cached layers via MinIO.
* **Scalable Microservices** â€“ Isolated, reproducible pipelines for each service.
* **Disaster Recovery** â€“ Redeploy Jenkins and all configs in minutes.
